William Shakespeare's name is synonymous with many
of the famous lines he wrote in his plays and prose.
 Yet his poems are not nearly as recognizable to many as the characters and
 famous monologues from his many plays.

In Shakespeare's era (1564-1616), it was not profitable but very fashionable
 to write poetry. It also provided credibility to his talent as a writer and
 helped to enhance his social standing. It seems writing poetry was something
 he greatly enjoyed and did mainly for himself at times when he was not consumed
  with writing a play. Because of their more private nature, few poems, particularly
  long-form poems, have been published.

The two longest works that scholars agree were written by Shakespeare are
entitled Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. Both dedicated to the
Honorable Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, who seems to have acted
as a sponsor and encouraging benefactor of Shakespeare's work for a brief time.

Both of these poems contain dozens of stanzas and comment on the depravity
of unwanted sexual advances, showing themes throughout of guilt, lust, and
 moral confusion. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis must reject the
  sexual advances of Venus. Conversely in The Rape of Lucrece, the honorable
   and virtuous wife Lucrece is raped a character overcome with lust, Tarquin.
    The dedication to Wriothesley is much warmer in the second poem,
    suggesting a deepening of their relationship and Shakespeare's appreciation of his support.

A third and shorter narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, was printed
in the first collection of Shakespeare's sonnets. Most scholars agree
now that it was also written by Shakespeare, though that was contested
 for some time. The poem tells the story of a young woman who is driven
 to misery by a persuasive suitor's attempts to seduce her. It is not
 regarded by critics to be his finest work.

Another short poem, The Phoenix and the Turtle, despairs the death of a
legendary phoenix and his faithful turtle dove lover. It speaks to the
frailty of love and commitment in a world where only death is certain.

There are 152 short sonnets attributed to Shakespeare. Among them,
the most famous ones are Sonnet 29, Sonnet 71, and Sonnet 55.
As a collection, narrative sequence of his Sonnets speaks to Shakespeare's
 deep insecurity and jealousy as a lover, his grief at separation, and his
 delight in sharing beautiful experiences with his romantic counterparts.
 However, few scholars believe that the sequence of the sonnets accurately
 depicts the order in which they were written. Because Shakespeare seemed to
  write primarily for his own private audience, dating these short jewels of
   literature has been next to impossible.
